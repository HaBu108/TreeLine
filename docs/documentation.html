<a id="introduction_1" /><b>Introduction</b><br /><br />
<div><a id="version" />This document covers TreeLine, Version 2.0.2, released October 3, 2015 by Doug Bell.<br /><br />
<a id="why_treeline" />Do you have lots of sticky notes lying around with various useful information jotted down? Or many lists of books, movies, links, website logins, personal contacts, or things to do? Can you find them when you need them? Well, I often couldn't. So here's my answer.<br /><br />
<a id="outliner_vs_database" />Treeline is both an outliner and a small database. It stores almost any kind of information. A tree structure makes it easy to keep things organized. And each node in the tree can contain several fields, forming a database. The output format for each node can be defined, and the output can be shown on the screen, printed, or exported to HTML or text.<br /><br />
<a id="license" />Since I'm not in the software business, I'm making this program free for anyone to use, distribute and modify, as long as it stays non-proprietary.  TreeLine is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either Version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

<a id="installation" /><b>Installation</b><br /><br />
<div><a id="linux_1" /><b>Linux</b><br /><br />
<div>Extract the source files from the treeline tar file, then change to the TreeLine directory in a terminal. For a basic installation, simply execute the following command as root: "python install.py".<br /><br />
If your distribution defaults to Python 2.x, you may need to substitute "python3", "python3.2" or "python3.3" for "python" in these commands.<br /><br />
To see all install options, use: "python install.py -h". To install TreeLine with a different prefix (the default is /usr/local), use:  "python install.py -p /prefix/path".<br /><br /></div>
<a id="windows_1" /><b>Windows</b><br /><br />
<div>To install for all users, execute the "TreeLine-x.x.x-install-all.exe" file.  Administrator permissions are required.<br /><br />
To install for a single user (administrator rights are not required), execute the "TreeLine-x.x.x-install-user.exe" file.<br /><br />
For a portable install, execute the "TreeLine-x.x.x-install-user.exe" file. The file association, shortcuts and uninstaller tasks should be unchecked. When TreeLine starts and prompts for the config file location, choose the program directory option.<br /><br /></div></div>
<a id="basic_usage" /><b>Basic Usage</b><br /><br />
<div><a id="views" /><b>Views</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Tree View - </b>The left-hand view shows a tree of node titles. Parent nodes can be opened and closed to display or hide their indented descendant nodes. Clicking on an already selected node allows the title to be edited.  Right-click context menus are available for commonly used functions.<br /><br />
<b>Right-hand Views - </b>The right pane is tabbed to show one of three different views of the data. The "Data Output" view shows the formatted text, the "Data Edit" view shows a text edit boxes, and the "Title List" view shows an editable list of node titles.<br />
<br />
When a parent node is selected in the tree, the right view will default to showing information about the selected node in an upper pane and information about the selected node's children in a lower pane. The "View &gt; Show Child Pane" command will toggle the display of the child nodes. If the selected node has no children, the view will show a single pane with information about the selected node only.<br />
<br />
When multiple nodes are selected in the tree (by holding down the shift or Ctrl keys while clicking), the right view will not display any child node information. It will instead show information about every selected node.<br /><br />
<b>Data Output View - </b>The "Data Output" view shows formatted output text. It cannot be edited from this view.<br />
<br />
When the "View &gt; Show Output Descendants" command is toggled, the "Data Output" view will show an indented list with information about every descendant of a single selected node.<br /><br />
<b>Data Edit View - </b>The "Data Edit" view shows a text edit box for each data field within a node.  It also shows the node types and the node titles.  The types of edit boxes vary based on the field type.  Some are just text editors, while others (such as choice fields, date fields, links, etc.) have pull-down menus or dialogs.<br /><br />
<b>Title List View - </b>The "Title List" view shows a list of node titles that can be modified using typical text editor methods.  If a new line is typed, a new node is created with that title.  If a line is deleted, the corresponding node is removed from the tree.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="editing" /><b>Editing</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Node Menu - </b>The commands in the "Node" menu operate on the selected nodes in the left tree view. There are commands to add or insert nodes, rename node titles and delete nodes. There are also commands to rearrange the tree by changing indent levels or moving nodes up or down. For many of the commands, the descendants of the selected nodes are also affected.<br /><br />
<b>Edit Menu - </b>The edit menu includes undo and redo commands that can fix problems.  Cut, copy and paste commands can operate either on text in the right-hand view (if selected or active) or to tree nodes.  It also has text formatting commands that are active when using edit boxes in the Data Edit view.<br /><br />
<b>Shortcuts - </b>There are several shortcuts for use in tree editing. Drag and drop will move (or copy if the Ctrl button is held) nodes. Clicking on a selected node will rename it. Pressing the delete key will remove the selected nodes. If desired, these shortcuts can be disabled in "Tools &gt; General Options".<br /><br /></div>
<a id="files" /><b>Files</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Templates - </b>When starting a new file, a dialog box offers a choice of templates. The default has only a single text field for each node that contains the title. The Long Text template adds a second long text field for more output text. Other templates have various fields for contacts, book lists and to-do lists.<br /><br />
<b>Sample Files - </b>Various TreeLine sample files can be opened by using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command.  These have more detail and example content than the new file templates.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="data_types" /><b>Data Types</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Node Types - </b>Multiple node data types can be defined in a TreeLine file. Each can contain different data fields and have different output formats. See the template and sample files for examples. Nodes can be set to a specific type using the "Data &gt; Set Node Type" command.<br /><br />
<b>Type Config - </b>The "Data &gt; Configure Data Types" command is used to modify node data types, fields and output formatting.  Refer to the Detailed Usage section of the full documentation for details.<br /><br /></div></div>
<a id="detailed_usage" /><b>Detailed Usage</b><br /><br />
<div><a id="tree_navigation_and_search" /><b>Tree Navigation and Search</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Keyboard Shortcuts - </b>There are several keyboard commands that can be used for tree navigation. The up and down arrow keys move the selection. The left and right arrows open and close the current node. Holding the CTRL and SHIFT keys with "J" or "K" moves between siblings, skipping children. The "Home", "End", "Page Up" and "Page Down" keys can be used to move quickly through the tree. The CTRL and SHIFT keys can be held with the "Page Up" and "Page Down" keys to move the tree view even when a different pane is focused.<br />
<br />
Another way to move through the tree is to type the first letter of a visible node title. Hitting the letter again moves to the next possibility.<br /><br />
<b>Selection - </b>Multiple nodes can be selected by holding down the CTRL or the SHIFT key when changing the active node. Individual nodes are added or removed from the selection when the CTRL key is held. The selection of all nodes between the old and new active nodes are toggled when SHIFT is held. The active node can be changed by using the mouse or by using any of the keyboard navigation methods.<br />
<br />
Note that multiple nodes selected with the CTRL key are output in the order selected.<br />
<br />
The "View &gt; Previous Selection" and "View &gt; Next Selection" commands can be used to toggle through a history of selections, allowing faster navigation through the tree.<br /><br />
<b>Searching - </b>The "Tools &gt; Find Text" command will search for text within the tree structure. The dialog box has options for searching all of the node data or only the node titles. There are also options for how to interpret the search text. Key words will match nodes with the search words found anywhere in the node. Key full words will only match complete words anywhere in the node. Full phrase will only match the complete phrase in the proper sequence. Finally, the regular expression option will search using Python regular expressions.<br />
<br />
The "Tools &gt; Conditional Find" command will search in particular node types and node fields. Various comparison operators can be selected to exactly match, to match a greater or lesser value, or part of the value. And the True/False operators give the same result regardless of the values. In general, the value is interpreted using the edit format for special field types. Multiple rules can be added, connected with logical "and" or "or" operators.  The "All Types" option makes fields from every type are available, so that multiple node types to be part of the same search.  The condition will be false for node types that do not contain that field name.<br /><br />
<b>Filtering - </b>There are two filtering commands, "Tools &gt; Text Filter" and "Tools &gt; Conditional Filter".  They work like the corresponding search commands above, except that they show all of the matching nodes in a flat list that replaces the tree view.  The nodes can be selected and edited from this view.  Use the "End Filter" button to restore the full tree view.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="defining_node_types" /><b>Defining Node Types</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Type List - </b>The "Type List" is the first tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". The list of data types can be modified by the buttons on the right. New types can be added, and existing types can be copied, renamed or deleted.<br /><br />
<b>Type Config - </b>"Type Config" is the second tab of the Configure Types Dialog. It contains a selection for the default child type. If set, this will be the initial type used for new children with this type of parent. If set to "[None]", children will default to either the type of their siblings or their parent.<br />
<br />
The "Change Icon" button allows the selection of a custom tree icon for this data type. The "Clear Select" button on the icon dialog can be used to set the icon to "None", so that no icon will be displayed for this type. To avoid showing any tree icons, the "Show icons in the tree view" general option can be unset.<br />
<br />
There are also options here for adding blanks lines between nodes, allowing HTML tags in the common format text, and changing the output  to add bullets or tables.<br /><br />
<b>Field List - </b>The "Field List" is the third tab of the Configure Types Dialog. The list of fields within a data type can be modified by using the buttons on the right. New fields can be added, and existing fields can be moved, renamed or deleted.<br /><br />
<b>Field Config - </b>"Field Config" is the fourth tab of the Configure Types Dialog. The field type and its output format string can be set, if applicable to the field. Extra prefix and suffix text to be output with the field can also be set, and a default field value for new nodes can be entered. Finally, the number of lines displayed in the editor for the field can be specified.<br /><br />
<b>Output - </b>"Output" is the last tab of the Configure Types Dialog. The left half of the dialog shows the fields. The right half shows the formatting for the title (used for the node text in the tree view) and the node output. The formatting consists of text lines with embedded fields. The fields are shown as "{*field_name*}". The field that is selected in the list can be added to a format at the cursor position with the "&gt;&gt;" keys. The field reference at the cursor can be removed with the "&lt;&lt;" keys.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="field_types" /><b>Field Types</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Field Options - </b>The field type and options are set in the "Field Config" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". The many different field types are described in the paragraphs below.<br />
<br />
Several of the field types use a formatting string to define their output. For a list of available formatting characters, use the "Format Help" button. Entries in the data editor which do not match the format will cause a blue triangle to show in the upper left corner of the edit box, and the output for that field will be replaced with "#####".<br /><br />
<b>Text Type - </b>The default field type is a text field. It is the most commonly used field.  These fields are edited using edit boxes in the data editor view. There are several commands in the Edit menu (and also in the context menu) for setting the font style and adding external or internal links. The edit box height expands when re-displayed after adding several lines of text. The minimum edit box height can also be set explicitly in the "Field Config" tab.<br /><br />
<b>HTML Text Type - </b>This type allows simple HTML tags to be used in the text. Commonly used tags include "&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;", "&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;", "line break&lt;br/&gt;", "horizontal line&lt;hr/&gt;", and various font tags. Complex block tags should generally be avoided. Carriage returns are ignored and non-escaped "&lt;", "&gt;" and "&amp;" symbols do not display. <br /><br />
<b>One Line Text Type - </b>This type restricts the text length to a single line.  It does not allow carriage returns, but does not restrict line wrapping of a single long line.<br /><br />
<b>Spaced Text Type - </b>This type holds plain text and preserves all spacing.  Other formatting of the text is not permitted.  It could be useful to use the "Tools &gt; Customize Fonts" command to set the editor font to a mono-spaced font when using this field type.<br /><br />
<b>Number Type - </b>In the number type, special characters in the format define the display of the numbers. The format uses a string of "#" (optional digit) and "0" (required digit) characters to define the output formatting. For example, pi formatted with "#.#" is "3.1" and formatted with "00.00" is "03.14". Regardless of the formatting, digits to the left of the decimal point are not truncated, since that would display an incorrect result. But use care to show enough decimal places (either optional or required) to avoid problems with round-off error.<br />
<br />
The radix character can be specified as either "." or "," to handle internationalization. For use as a thousands separator, use "\," or "\.". For example, a large number may be formatted as "#\,###\,###.##" or as "#\.###\.###,##". Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog for more formatting details. <br />
<br />
Unlike most other formats, the number type also uses the output format for display in the Data Editor. Of course, any new entry with a reasonable format is correctly interpreted (but the correct radix character must be used).<br /><br />
<b>Boolean Type - </b>This type gives two choices corresponding to true/false values. The format help menu includes typical values such as "yes/no", "true/false" and "1/0", but users can also enter their own word pair. The data editor boxes will accept either the currently set format or any of the typical values.<br /><br />
<b>Date Type - </b>In the date field type, special characters in the format are replaced by elements of the data, similar to number fields. Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog for formatting details. <br />
<br />
There is also an edit format under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Data Editor Formats". This controls how date fields are displayed in the Data Editor view. Generally, entries in the data editor with various formats will be correctly interpreted regardless of this setting, but dates must use the correct day-month-year sequence. Also note that the date editor format does not support days of the week.<br />
<br />
A default initial field value of "Now" can be used to enter the date of node creation.<br /><br />
<b>Time Type - </b>In the time field type, special characters in the format are replaced by elements of the data, similar to number fields. Press the "Format Help" button from the field format dialog for formatting details. <br />
<br />
There is also an edit format under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Data Editor Formats". This controls how time fields are displayed in the Data Editor view. Generally, entries in the data editor with various formats will be correctly interpreted regardless of this setting.<br />
<br />
A default initial field value of "Now" can be used to enter the time of node creation.<br /><br />
<b>Choice Type - </b>The choice field type allows for the selection of text items from a pull-down edit list. The formatting strings for these types list the items separated with the "/" character (use "//" to get a literal "/" in an item).  Entries in the data editor which do not match the choices will cause a blue triangle to show in the upper left corner of the edit box, and the output for that field will be replaced with "#####".<br /><br />
<b>Auto Choice Type - </b>This field type is similar to the choice type, but without a format string. The entries in the pull-down menu are automatically generated from all previously used entries. Any entries that are typed will be available in the pull-down menu for future use. <br /><br />
<b>Combination Type - </b>This is basically the equivalent of the choice type with multiple selection. The formatting string entries are separated by the "/" character. The pull-down menu shows check-boxes that are checked for currently selected nodes. By default, the selected entries are output separated by a comma and a space. This can be changed in the "Type Config" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". Click the "Show Advanced" button to see the separator setting.<br /><br />
<b>Auto Combination Type - </b>This field type is similar to the combination type, but without a format string. The entries in the pull-down menu are automatically generated from all previously used entries. Any entries that are typed will be available in the pull-down menu for future use. <br /><br />
<b>External Link Type - </b>This type can support various link protocols, including http and https for web pages, mailto for email addresses and file for local files.  A pull down dialog in the data editor allows the selection of the protocol type and the entry of an address and a display name.  In the edit boxes, the display name shows up in [brackets], and it is used as the text of the link in the output view.  The "file" protocol also provides a button to browse for a path and buttons to choose either absolute or relative path names.<br />
<br />
Clicking on the link in the output view or choosing "Open Link" from the right-click context menu in the edit box will open the link in a web browser.   In Linux, setting the "BROWSER" environment variable to a string like "mozilla %s" will result in the desired browser being used.<br /><br />
<b>Internal Link Type - </b>These links create shortcuts to select nodes elsewhere in the tree structure. The unique ID of the referenced node is entered along with a display name. The pull down dialog in the data editor has an "Enable click on target" button. Once clicked, the target node can be selected and the appropriate unique node ID will be entered. Like external links, this link can be clicked in the output view, or "Open Link" can be chosen from the right-click context menu.<br /><br />
<b>Picture Type - </b>These links add referenced pictures to the output view. A pull down dialog in the data editor has a button to browse for picture files to be linked. It also allows absolute or relative paths to be used and has a small image preview.<br /><br />
<b>Math Type - </b>Math field types are configured by defining equations. The equations can reference number fields, date fields, time fields, boolean fields, text fields and/or other math fields. The resulting values of math fields are automatically calculated for each node.<br />
<br />
To define a math field equation, press the "Define Equation" button in the "Field Config" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". This brings up a dialog with fields to reference on the left and math operators on the right. The "Reference Level" pull-down determines whether the reference is from the same node, the node's parent, the root node, or the node's children. The "Result Type" pull-down allows numeric, date, time, boolean or text results to be chosen. The "Operator Type" pull-down allows numeric, comparison or text operators to be shown in the operator list. The down-arrow buttons below the references and operators add the selected item to the equation text below. Portions of equations can also be typed directly in the equation text line editor.<br />
<br />
References to child nodes must be enclosed in a grouping function, such as sum, max, min, mean or join. A math field can contain a parent or child reference to itself, but not a same-level reference to itself (a circular reference). The references only contain the field name, so they will reference a parent or child field with that name even if it is a different node type.<br />
<br />
In equations, date fields are represented by the number of days since January 1, 1970, and time fields are the number of seconds since midnight. So date fields can be subtracted to give the number of days elapsed, and numbers of days can be added to or subtracted from dates to result in new dates. Time fields can be subtracted to give the number of seconds elapsed, and numbers of seconds can be added to or subtracted from times to result in new times.<br />
<br />
The "if" comparison operator can be used to make the result depend on the value of another field. The expression is written as "true_value if condition else false_value".  Of course, the "true_value", "condition" and "false_value" strings must be replaced with valid fields or expressions.  If this operator is inserted from the operator list (under comparisons), it will include parenthesis as placeholders.  These parenthesis are optional in the equations.<br />
<br />
The "join" text function is used to combine text from several other fields (or from child nodes). The first argument to the function is a separator string that is placed between each piece of text. The remaining argument(s) are the text to be joined.<br />
<br />
By default, math fields are shown in the data edit view, but they are read-only. To hide them, uncheck the "Show math fields in the Data Edit View" box under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Features Available".<br />
<br />
There is also an option under "File &gt; Properties" that toggles whether blank fields are treated as zeros. If checked (the default), a blank field that is referenced by a math field has a value of zero (for numeric operations) or blank (for text operations). If unchecked, any blank references also cause equations that reference them to be blank.<br />
<br /><br />
<a id="numbering_type" /><b>Numbering Type - </b>This type (not to be confused with the number type above) provides fields that are automatically filled in with the "Data &gt; Update Numbering" command. The "Format Help" button in the field format dialog shows the output format options. A single format level will result in a simple sequential numbering scheme. Use of the "/" level separator will result in an outline-type numbering with different sequences at different levels. Use of the "." section separator will result in a "2.3.5" type numbering scheme.<br />
<br />
Since numbering fields are automatically populated, by default they are not shown in the data edit view.  To show them, check the "Show numbering fields in the Data Edit View" box under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Features Available".  When they are shown in the data edit view, they show up in section numbering style, regardless of the output format.<br /><br />
<b>Regular Expression Type - </b>This type allows arbitrary format strings to be matched that restrict the data to a particular format. It uses Python regular expression syntax. Entries in the data editor which do not match the format string expression will cause a blue triangle to show in the upper left corner of the edit box, and the output for that field will be replaced with "#####".<br /><br /></div>
<a id="output_formatting_details" /><b>Output Formatting Details</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Output Format Examples - </b>Here is an example of output formatting for a book list:<br />
<br />
"{*Title*}"<br />
(c) {*Copyright*}, Rating: {*Rating*}<br />
{*PlotDescription*}<br />
<br />
Each of the field names in enclosed in {* *}, curly brackets and asterisks.  For more examples, see the sample files that can be opened using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command.<br /><br />
<b>Title Formats - </b>When a node in the tree is renamed, the program attempts to match the title formatting pattern to set the appropriate fields (the same title matching occurs when editing lines in the "Title List" view). If the title formatting is too complex, it may not correctly guess the intent. Things like adjacent fields with no characters separating them should be avoided unless you do not wish to rename nodes from the tree.<br />
<br />
If the text data used for a tree view title has multiple lines, only the first line will be used as the title.<br /><br />
<b>Skipped Output Lines - </b>If a line in the output formatting contains one or more fields and all of those fields for a given node are empty, the line is skipped. No blank line or embedded text will be output for that line. Note that this does not apply to a line without any fields (only embedded text). Also, when a line ending with a &lt;br/&gt; or an &lt;hr/&gt; tag is skipped, the ending tag is retained.<br /><br />
<b>HTML Tags - </b>By default, the "Allow HTML rich text in formats" option is unchecked  in the "Type Config"  tab of the Configure Types Dialog.  So any HTML tags are treated as plain text.  If the option is enabled, simple HTML formatting tags can be used in node output formats.<br />
<br />
Commonly used tags include "&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;", "&lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;", "line break&lt;br/&gt;", "horizontal line&lt;hr/&gt;", and various font tags. Complex block tags should generally be avoided.<br /><br />
<b>Other Field References - </b>References to fields that are not contained within the node can be added to the output. Pushing the "Show Advanced" button on the "Output" tab of the configure dialog makes a reference level selection become visible.<br />
<br />
If the reference level is changed to "File Info Reference", fields containing file meta-data can be added to the output. These include the file name, path, size, modified day and modified time. A field referencing the node's unique ID is also included here.  These special fields are shown as "{*!field_name*}" in the title and output format editors.<br />
<br />
There are field references to various ancestor nodes (parents, grandparents, etc.). These require the data type of the reference to be specified. This selection determines the field names that are available, but the data from any type with a matching field name will be shown in the output. References to fields from parent and grandparent nodes are shown as "{**field_name*}" and "{***field_name*}", respectively. There are also general ancestor references, shown as "{*?field_name*}", that take data from the closest ancestor with a matching field.<br />
<br />
References to child nodes can also be added. These also require that the child data type be specified. The child data becomes embedded in the parent output. The child data is delimited with a separator string defined on the "Type Config" tab (with show advanced active). The separator defaults to a comma and a space, but can be set to &lt;br/&gt; or anything else.<br />
<br />
Finally, a "Child Count" reference can be added. This field will show the number of children ("Level1" field) or grandchildren ("Level2" field) of a node. These are shown as {*#Level1*} in the format editors.<br />
<br />
For examples of these fields, see the "sample_other_fields" file (by using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command).<br /><br /></div>
<a id="type_format_details" /><b>Type Format Details</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Unique IDs - </b>Every node has a Unique ID string associated with it. The IDs are used for addresses in internal links and in other places where TreeLine needs to identify a particular node.By default, the text in the first field is used to generate the ID. This can be changed in the "Type Config" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". Click the "Show Advanced" button to see the "Unique ID Reference Field" setting. <br />
<br />
To create the Unique ID, text in the reference field is modified by removing spaces and other special characters, shortening long entries, and adding extra characters if required to be unique in the file. If the content of the reference field changes, the Unique ID is updated, along with any links that reference it.<br />
<br />
The Unique IDs can be shown in the data edit view by checking the "Show node unique IDs in the Data Edit View" box under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Features Available". <br /><br />
<b>Generic and Derived Types - </b>Data types can be set to derive their field settings from a generic type. This allows types with different output formatting to always use the same set of fields. Any changes to the generic's list of fields and field types are automatically reflected in the fields of all derived types. This does not apply to a field's output formatting, which can still be set independently.<br />
<br />
There are two methods for creating derived types. First, a derived option can be selected when copying a type on the "Type List" tab of the "Data &gt; Configure Types Dialog". Alternately, a generic type can be specified from the derived type's "Type Config" tab of the dialog if the advanced functions are shown.<br /><br />
<b>Conditional Types - </b>Conditional expressions can be used to automatically assign a data type based on each node's content. Conditions can be assigned only to a generic type and its associated derived types. This allows the automatic assignment of different output formatting or different icons depending on each node's field data.<br />
<br />
The conditional dialog box is accessed from a button on the "Type Config" tab of the "Data-&gt;Configure Types Dialog" if the advanced functions are shown. Each line of the condition includes a field, an operator and a comparison value. The operators include equality, greater than, less than, starts with, ends with, and contains. There are also True and False operators that will toggle the type of all nodes simultaneously.<br />
<br />
For special field types such as dates, times, and booleans, the comparison value should be entered in the same format that is used in the Data Editor window. In general, the starts with, ends with, and contains operators should not be used for these special fields, since the comparison is done using an internal data representation. Dates and times also support a special comparison value of "now", which is always interpreted as the current date and time.<br />
<br />
The "Add New Rule" button is used to add additional condition lines. The lines can be joined with "and" or "or" operators. The "Remove Rule" button deletes the last condition line. If only a single line is present, the "Remove Rule" button completely removes the condition.<br />
<br />
Conditions do not have to be set for all types in a family. If no conditions are true for a node, the program will select a blank condition over a false one.<br />
<br />
For an example, see the "sample_conditional_todo" file (by using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command).<br /><br />
<b>Copying Formats - </b>Another method for changing data type formatting is to copy the formats from another TreeLine file. This is done with the "Data &gt; Copy Types from File" command. All types from the chosen file are copied. Any types in the current file with matching names are overwritten, but types with unique names are retained.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="tree_data_operations" /><b>Tree Data Operations</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Sorting - </b>The "Data &gt; Sort Nodes" command can sort nodes based on either node titles or key fields predefined in the node type configuration. The predefined sort fields can be changed in the "Field Config" tab of the Configure Types Dialog. The "Sort Keys" button brings up a list of fields that define a sort key sequence.  The fields higher in the sequence have a higher priority.  The direction for each key field can be flipped.<br /><br />
<b>Numbering - </b>The "Data &gt; Update Numbering" command updates the contents of fields with a special numbering field type. The field's output format defines how the numbers are displayed in the output, including whether individual numbers, outline numbers or a section numbering scheme are shown. See the <a href="#numbering_type">Numbering Field Type</a> for more information.<br />
<br />
Note that numbering fields are not shown in the data edit view unless "Show numbering fields in the Data Edit View" is checked under "Tools &gt; General Options &gt; Features Available". When they are shown in the data edit view, they show up in section numbering style, regardless of the output format.<br /><br />
<b>Find and Replace - </b>The "Tools &gt; Find and Replace" command can be used to change the text in several nodes. The search text and replacement text are entered. Searching can be based on any match, full words only, or a Python regular expression. The operation can optionally be restricted to a particular node type and to a particular node field.<br />
<br />
Replacement using regular expressions is quite powerful. Searching for ".*" will match all of the text in the field. The replacement string can contain back references that consist of a backslash and a number. The back references get replaced with the corresponding parenthesized group from the match. For example, "\2" will be replaced with the text that matched the second group of parenthesis. The "\g&lt;0&gt;" back-reference can be used to substitute the entire matching string.<br /><br />
<b>Spell Check - </b>There is a spell check command in the "Tools" menu. Use of this command requires an external program to be installed (either aspell, ispell or hunspell- see the <a href="#system_requirements">System Requirements</a> section). If there are any misspelled words in the selected branch, a dialog will allow the word to be ignored, added to the dictionary, replaced with a suggestion or edited. This will spell check the text in all data fields of each node.<br /><br />
<b>Category-Based Arrangement - </b>The "Data" menu contains commands for arranging and flattening the data by category and by internal links. These methods are used to automatically add and remove levels of nodes below the current node in the tree.<br />
<br />
The "Add Category Level" command allows you to select one or more of the fields that the child nodes have in common. These fields are used to create new parent nodes for the children, grouping them by common categories. For example, in a list of books, picking the "author_first_name" and "author_last_name" fields will result in a tree with the books under new nodes for each unique author.<br />
<br />
The "Flatten by Category" command is almost the opposite of "Add Category Level". It eliminates any descendant nodes with children, transferring their data fields to their children. It will rename fields instead of overwriting data with the same field names, but this command is most useful when the children and parents are different types with unique field names.<br /><br />
<b>Link-Based Arrangement - </b>The "Data &gt; Flatten by Link" command will move all descendant nodes directly under a root node in a flat structure.  It will add an internal link field to each node that points to the node's former parent.<br />
<br />
The "Data &gt; Arrange by Link" command does the opposite, placing each node under a parent node that is referenced by an internal link field.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="printing_1" /><b>Printing</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Print Setup - </b>The dialog for print setup contains four tabs. The first, General Options, includes settings for what part of the tree to print, whether to include lines to child nodes and whether to allow page breaks between a parent an its first child node. The second tab, Page Setup, includes paper size, orientation, margins and columns. The third tab selects the font for printing. The last tab, Header/Footer, defines text and file data meta-fields for inclusion in headers and footers.<br /><br />
<b>Print Preview - </b>The Print Preview window shows how the printout will look with current print settings.  It can be dragged larger to show more detail, or the zoom settings can be changed.  It also includes buttons for the Print Setup dialog and for printing.<br /><br />
<b>Print to PDF - </b>This command prompts for a path and file name to export a PDF file.  It uses the current printer settings.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="file_handling_1" /><b>File Handling</b><br /><br />
<div><b>File Compression - </b>A TreeLine file is in an XML text format. There are also options to work with compressed files (gzip format) to save storage space. Individual files can be set to compressed mode from either "File &gt; Properties" or from the file type pull-down in the save-as dialog.<br /><br />
<b>File Encryption - </b>There is a file encryption option to password protect TreeLine files. Individual files can be set to encrypted mode from either "File &gt; Properties" or from the file type pull-down in the save-as dialog. The encryption uses an SHA hash function as a stream cipher - it should be fairly secure.<br /><br />
<b>Auto-Save - </b>An auto-save feature can store unsaved files with a "~" appended to the file name. The backup files are automatically removed when the file is saved or TreeLine exits cleanly. The auto-save time interval is set in the general options. Setting the interval to zero disables this feature.<br /><br />
<b>Saved Tree States - </b>When opening a recently used file, TreeLine will restore the states of open and selected nodes. This information is stored in the user's TreeLine configuration files. If desired, this feature can be disabled with a general option.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="file_import" /><b>File Import</b><br /><br />
<div><b>General Information - </b>A TreeLine file is in a specific XML text format. Other types of files can be imported using the "File &gt; Import" command, which will show a dialog box where the type of import can be selected.  Alternatively, using the "File &gt; Open" command with a non-TreeLine file will also show this dialog.<br /><br />
<b>Text Import - </b>There are four different text formats that can be selected for import.  Tab indented text creates a node title from each line in the file, structured based on the number of tabs before each line.  A tab delimited text table uses the first line as a header row to create field names, then each additional row becomes a node with field data taken from each column. The plain text, one node per line import creates a flat tree of node titles.  Finally, the plain text paragraph import creates long text nodes from text separated by blank lines.<br /><br />
<b>Treepad Import - </b>Files from the Treepad shareware program can be imported. Only Treepad text nodes are supported.<br /><br />
<b>XML Import - </b>TreeLine will import and export generic XML files. These routines do not have much intelligence - each XML element becomes a node and each XML attribute becomes a field. XML text content become fields named "Element_Data". This lets TreeLine function as a crude XML editor.<br /><br />
<b>ODF Import - </b>TreeLine will import Open Document Format (ODF) text documents, from applications such as Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. The node structure is formed based on the heading styles assigned in the document. Any text under each heading is assigned to that heading's node. The import filter is intended for simple text outlines only. No formatting is maintained, and objects such as tables and pictures are not imported.<br /><br />
<b>Bookmarks Import - </b>TreeLine will import bookmark files in both the Mozilla HTML format (Firefox browser) and the XBEL format (Konqueror, Galeon and Elinks browsers). Each bookmark becomes a node with a name and a link field. Some information in the files, such as visited dates and icon references, is not imported. For an example, see the "sample_bookmarks" file (by using the "File &gt; Open Sample" command).<br />
<br /><br /></div>
<a id="file_export" /><b>File Export</b><br /><br />
<div><b>General Information - </b>Files are exported using the "File &gt; Export" command. This will show a dialog box of available export types and options.<br /><br />
<b>HTML Export - </b>The HMTL export subtypes can export to a single page or to multiple pages.  The single page export contains all of the indented output.  A navigation pane on the left with links to anchors at node positions is optional.<br />
<br />
The multiple HTML pages export has one web page per node.  It includes a navigation pane on the left with links to the pages with sibling, parent and aunt/uncle nodes.<br />
<br />
Multiple HTML data tables export creates a table in each HTML file that contains the data for a set of siblings, as well as links to the parent and child pages.<br /><br />
<b>Text Export - </b>Data can be exported to tabbed title text and tab-delimited tables. These formats are the same as the corresponding import formats. When exporting to a table, only the first level of children is used, so you may wish to flatten the data before exporting.<br />
<br />
There is also an unformatted text export the dumps all of the output into a text file without preserving the tree structure.<br /><br />
<b>XML Export - </b>TreeLine will import and export generic XML files. These routines do not have much intelligence - each node becomes an XML element and each field becomes an XML attribute, except for fields named "Element_Data" that become the element's text. This lets TreeLine function as a crude XML editor.<br /><br />
<b>ODF Export - </b>TreeLine will export an outline to an Open Document Format (ODF) text document, compatible with Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. The title of each node is assigned a heading style at the appropriate level. Any other text in the output of each node becomes normal text under the heading. The export filter is intended for simple text outlines only. Any HTML formatting is stripped, and objects such as tables and pictures are not supported.<br /><br />
<b>Bookmarks Export - </b>TreeLine will export bookmark files in both the Mozilla HTML format (Firefox browser) and the XBEL format (Konqueror, Galeon and Elinks browsers). TreeLine will look for a link field in each node that becomes the target of the bookmark.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="customizations" /><b>Customizations</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Options - </b>TreeLine's behavior can be modified with several settings available in "Tools &gt; General Options". Most of these options are covered elsewhere in this document.<br /><br />
<b>Keyboard Shortcuts - </b>Keyboard shortcuts can be customized by using the "Tools &gt; Set Keyboard Shortcuts" command. Simply type the new key sequence with the appropriate field selected.<br /><br />
<b>Toolbars - </b>An editor to customize the toolbars is available from "Tools &gt; Customize Toolbars". The number of toolbars can be set, and the buttons on each can be defined.<br /><br />
<b>Fonts - </b>Fonts used in the tree views, the output view and the editor views can be set in the "Tools &gt; Customize Fonts" menu.<br /><br />
<b>Tree Icons - </b>There is an icons directory in the user configuration directory ("~/.treeline-x.x/icons" on Linux, "Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\roaming\bellz\treeline-x.x\icons" on Windows). Image files (PNG or BMP) placed into this directory are available for use as tree icons.<br /><br /></div>
<a id="plugins_1" /><b>Plugins</b><br /><br />
<div><b>Description - </b>TreeLine has an interface for plugin extension modules. This allows extensions to be written by various programmers to provide features needed by a few users without adding bloat to the main application. The plugins can add new menu items, access and modify TreeLine data, and read and write TreeLine Files.<br />
<br />
Currently available plugins are listed on the "Downloads" page of the TreeLine web site.<br /><br />
<b>Installation - </b>The plugins are installed by copying their Python file (*.py) to a plugins directory. This can be a directory in the TreeLine installation ("&lt;prefix&gt;/share/treeline/plugins/" on Linux or "TreeLine-2\plugins\" under the Program Files or Application Data folders on Windows) or in the user configuration directory ("~/.treeline-2.x/plugins/" on Linux, "Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\bellz\treeline-2.x\plugins\" on Windows). A list of loaded plugins can be found using the "Help &gt;About Plugins" command.<br /><br />
<b>Programming Interface - </b>Information needed to write new plugins can be found in the "plugininterface.py" file in the TreeLine source code.<br /><br /></div></div>

<a id="march_29_2015_-_release_197_unstable" /><b>March 29, 2015 - Release 1.9.7 (unstable development snapshot)</b><br /><br />
<div><b>New Features</b><br />
<ul><div><li>Added comparison operators and conditional if statements to math field equations. The operators can be used with a new boolean result type, or as a part of numeric, date, time or text expressions.</li>
<li>Text operators were made available in math field equations, and the result type can be set to text. This allows math fields to combine text from other fields, replace substrings and change capitalization.</li></div></ul>
<b>Updates</b><br />
<ul><div><li>Added a "file saved" status bar message.</li>
<li>Added a German GUI translation.</li>
<li>Updated the Portuguese GUI translation.</li></div></ul>
<b>Bug Fixes</b><br />
<ul><div><li>Fixed a focus problem that made Combination and AutoCombination field editor pull-downs unusable.</li>
<li>Fixed a focus problem that made the pull-downs in choice and boolean field editors unusable on Linux.</li><br /></div></div></ul>
<a id="march_10_2015_-_release_196_unstable" /><b>March 10, 2015 - Release 1.9.6 (unstable development snapshot)</b><br /><br />
<div><b>New Features</b><br />
<ul><div><li>Added a new OneLineText field type that restricts the text length to a single line.</li>
<li>Added an All Types option to the conditional find and filter commands. This allows multiple node types to be found or filtered at the same time. The fields from every type are available for use in conditions. The conditions give a false result for all node types that do not contain that field name.</li>
<li>Added support for date and time calculations using math fields. Math equation result types can be set to numeric, date or time output. Date fields can be subtracted to give the number of days elapsed, and numbers of days can be added to or subtracted from dates, resulting in new dates. Time fields can be subtracted to give the number of seconds elapsed, and numbers of seconds can be added to or subtracted from times, resulting in new times.</li>
<li>In math fields, added an equation reference level to reference fields in the root node. This provides a place for "constant" field values that can be referenced from any node but only need to be changed in one location.</li>
<li>Support was added for plugin extension modules. Most of the interface methods from TreeLine 1.4.x were duplicated to ease porting of old plugins. Of course, old plugins must be ported from Python 2.x to Python 3.x, and there are multi-window implementation differences. New interfaces allow the creation of new field types and the execution of any menu command. Sample plugins are available on the TreeLine download page.</li>
<li>Added text formatting and link commands for HTML fields that add tags to the HTML content.</li>
<li>An open in folder command was added to external link field editors to open the directory in a file manager.</li>
<li>Added the Select All command to global menus with a different default shortcut key (ctrl-L) to avoid conflicts with the add child shortcut.</li></div></ul>
<b>Updates</b><br />
<ul><div><li>Improved the focus handling for data edit view edit boxes. This eliminates the blue outline for boxes in inactive data edit views. It also makes tab-to-focus more predictable, including fully selecting single-line field types when they receive tab focus.</li>
<li>Data edit boxes are now automatically resized when editing is complete and the focus moves to another row.</li>
<li>Allow files to be drag &amp; dropped on data edit boxes to create external links.</li>
<li>Small, non-modal dialogs, such as those for sorting, numbering, finding and filtering, have been set to stay on top, so they won't be obscured by TreeLine windows.</li>
<li>Made opening associated programs from external file links more consistent, especially in Linux.</li>
